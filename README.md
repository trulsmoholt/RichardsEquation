# RichardsEquation
A simple program to model groundwater flow with Ricards' [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richards_equation). The solution is computed with linear [finite elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) on a triangular mesh. Linearization is done with the L-scheme, a robust linear convergent shceme. Run benchmark for an example.
